#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering.

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Answer;
software engineering is the orderly application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It ussually involves the desighn, development, testing, deployment, and maintenace of software products.

Software Engineering Importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is important to the technology industry because it facilitates the development of reliable, secure, and efficient software systems and applications that power various aspects of the modern life. eg in in communication, commerce, healthcare and entertaiment.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Three key milestones in software engineering;
answers;

1.Rise of agile methods;
This emerged as a response to the then exististing limitations of traditional software development approaches. Agile software engineering included the introduction of sprint planning, Incrimental delivery and retrospectives.

2.Development of programming languages; 
The introduction of high-level languages like C and Fortran laid the foundation of for software engineering.

3.Advent of structured programming;
Due to the introduction of structred programming concepts, such as control structures and modularization improved the overall code quality and maintability.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
answers;
1. Requirments- This includes gathering and documenting requirments from stakeholders or users and their prefered system requirments.
2. Desighn- This phase involves creating a detailed high level software desighn document, outlining the system architecture, templates, programming languages and deciding on the right security measures.
3. Testing- In this phase various tests are conducted including perfomance testing, usability testing, acceptance testing and bug fixing. This ensures that the software meets the requirments and is free from defects and anticipated errors
4. Deployment- In the deployment phase, the final product is deployed to intended users. The software is made available fo use.
5. Maintenance-In this phase, ongoing support, bug fixing, and updates are made possible and available to the user to ensure the software remains secure, funtional and it meets any evolving need of the end user.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
answers;

In waterfall methodology, the linear and sequential approach are used with distint phases, i.e., requirments gathering, desigh, implementation, testing, deployment flowing down like waterfall. in this methodology, each phase is completed before moving to the next, and due to this approach, changes are difficult to incorporate once a phase is completed. 
In Agile methodology, the approach is diffrent as the iterative and incremental approach which focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change is used. it incorporates continous feedback and adaptation throughout the project.
Key Differences; Waterfall is more structred and predicatble, while Agile is more flexible and adaptable.

Scenario 1;
A well established company with strict requirments needs a new software: In this scenario the best methodology is waterfall. Reason being the project has  well-defined requirments, and it needs to ensure compliance with requlatory standards.

Scenario 2;
A small business needs a custom website, they have a clear scope and fixed budget:
Here the best methodology to use is still waterfall. The project has a well-defined scope and budget, and it needs a predictable timeline and outcome.

Scenario 3;
A startup needs a minimum viable product(mvp), they have limited resources and uncertain market demand.
In this situation, the best methodology to apply is Agile. Reason being, this project requires rapid prototyping and iteration to test the market and adapt to any changing requirments.

Scenario 4;
A large enterprise with with multiple stakeholders and competing priorities needs a system integration. 
In this scenario, the best methodology to apply is agile. reason being, the project requires adaptability and flexibility to accomodate any changing requirements and priorities, and to ensure easy stakeholder engagement and collaboration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

answers
Software Developer; Responsible for writing high-quality, well documented efficient code, and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer; Rensposible for ensuring the quality of software products through desighing and executing test plans validations.
Project Manager; Responsible for overseeing the entire software develepomennt lifecyle, from planning to execution to delivery, of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

answer;
Software engineering tools play a vital role in the software developemnt process as the the enhance collaboration and productivity, plus a facilitate code quality by providing developers with outstanding features such as code editors, debbuging tools, version control and automated testing capabilities. 

Examples;
IDEs- Visual studio code, Eclipse, Intellij IDEA, Lazarus.
VCS- Git, Subversion(SVN), Mecurial and Perforce

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

answer;
-Changing Requirements- During the development cycle, un avoidable circumstances might come up leading to change during the development cycle. This often leads to scope creep and project delays.
-Tight Deadlines- At times there are pressure to finish a software product on time, this often leads to rushed development and this in-turn compromises on the quality of the final software product.
-Technical Debt-This is ussually pops as a result of using shortcuts, or trying to incoporate suboptimal solutions. This technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase on the maintenance cost.

Strategies to overcome these challengers;

Diffrent approaches can be used to address this challengers, 
1.effective communication, through establish good communications plans between developers, end users and stake holders making sure everyone is informed and working towards a common goal
2.Agile methodolies, this offer flexible and adaptive approach to project management. This in turn allows teams to respond quickly to any changing requirements and priorities.
3.Priotirizing task, this is important as efforts are focused on the most critical aspects of the project.
4.Regular assesment of project goals, this ensures that the project remains in the scope of business and that stakeholders are are informed of any changes.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

answer;

-Unit Testing: This involves testing components or software modules individually, ie., one module after another.
-Integration Testing: This involves testing integrations between diffrent components or subsystems.
-System Testing: System setting involves testing the entire software as a whole, that is, taking the whole system and running tests on it.
-Acceptance Testing: In acceptance testing, the software is tested against user requirements to ensure it meets the specific user needs.





#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
answer;

Def: Prompt engineering is the process of crafting questions or instructions to effectively interact best with robots or AI assistant or AI models ensuring they produce accurate, relevant and consistent response.

Importance in Interacting with AI Models;

Good prompt engineering is important in interacting with Ai models. it enables users to precisely communicate their intent, overcome limitations in model understanding, and unlock full potential of ai generated outputs, hence transforming the user expirience and ensuring reliable and accurate results.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Answer;
Vague prompt: "Tell me about the benefits of prompt engineering."
Improved Prompt: "What are the top three ways that a well desighned prompt can improve the accuracy and relevace of AI-generated summaries for technical reports, in the field of hotel management specifically?"

why the improved prompt is more effective.
The improved prompt has specificity, it targets  a specicif application, and targets a specific type of output. its conciseness, the improved prompt is short and direct to the point, also it is more relevant, as it is tailored to a specific industry which is "hotel management" making the outcome response more relevant, meeting the users expectations
